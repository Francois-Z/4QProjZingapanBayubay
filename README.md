# The Roach's Revenge
4th Quarter Project of Bayubay and Zingapan. 
A CYOA that revolves arouund a cockroach and their adventures.

## DESCRIPTION: 
This project will be a Create Your Own Adventure (CYOA) short story game where the protagonist is a cockroach. Gross, yes, but it makes the story surreal. This game will utilize an RPG element of skill leveling where the player has certain skills or attributes to enhance whenever they level up.

## INPUT PAGES: 
1. The first page (index.html) will simply be a blank page except for a text field to ask for the player’s username to use throughout the game. 

2. The second page (htdocs/story.html) will be the main page where the player will take the most time as it will be the page where the story happens. The player will encounter events throughout the story where they can decide their own fate. Skill points will sometimes be taken into account for specific events, such as needing enough “dexterity” to weave through obstacles and the like.

3. The third pge (htdocs/skill.html) will be utilized for the player to enhance their skills/attributes for the reason said in the last paragraph. Four skills are available: wit, strength, dexterity, and charm.

## SUMMARIZING PAGE: 
The summarizing page (htdocs/end.html) will simply be the page that will show what ending the player achieved. It will also display the levels of the skills and also a button if they want to restart the game.

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 
There might be another page where the player can have save files just in case they want to go to a specific point in the story. However, we are unsure on how to implement that feature; we thought of cookies, but we’re not quite there yet in the course. There also might be an additional intro in the index page if ever we find that appealing.
